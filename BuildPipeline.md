Build Pipeline
1. Creating a build pipeline usually involves using a readymade template. Only, if we need some changes that are not readily available we might be required to add new tasks to customize the build pipeline to suit our needs.
2. We can use logs to identify the issues in the build pipeline
3. We can see the artifact by downloading it to ensure that it does not contain unnecessary files.

Release Pipeline
1. Similar to the build pipeline, release pipelines have a ready made template for most scenarios. It usually requires you to have ready service connection so that you can readily deploy your artifacts to your production environment.
